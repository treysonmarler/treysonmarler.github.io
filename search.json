    "text": "Omaha. It’s the most coveted destination for any player who dreams of playing at the highest level in college baseball. Every year 8 of the best teams gather in Omaha, Nebraska for the Men’s College World Series to crown the best team in the country. \nThe 2025 Men’s CWS is less than 2 months away and the college baseball regular season is roughly at the halfway point. Therefore, there should be a decent gauge of who will be making the trip to middle America later this year. \nLet’s take a look at the numbers.\nTo win at baseball you need to do 3 simple things: Score a lot of runs, give up few runs, and for fun hit some home runs along the way.\nFor starters, here is a look at the ERA, runs scored, and home run numbers of the 8 teams who made the College World Series last season as of March 31st, 2024. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nhr24 &lt;- read_csv(\"college_baseball_2024_homeruns.csv\")\n\nnewhr24 &lt;- hr24 |&gt; separate(`W-L`, into=c(\"W\", \"L\", \"T\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt; \n  separate(Team, into = c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep= \"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference = str_trim(Conference))\n\nera24 &lt;- read_csv(\"college_baseball_2024_era.csv\")\n\nnewera24 &lt;- era24 |&gt; separate(`W-L`, into=c(\"W\", \"L\", \"T\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt; \n  separate(Team, into = c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep= \"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference = str_trim(Conference))\n\nruns24 &lt;- read_csv(\"college_baseball_2024_runs.csv\")\n\nnewruns24 &lt;- runs24 |&gt; separate(`W-L`, into=c(\"W\", \"L\", \"T\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt; \n  separate(Team, into = c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep= \"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference = str_trim(Conference))\n\nhrcws24 &lt;- newhr24 |&gt;  \n  filter(School == \"North Carolina\" | School == \"Virginia\" | School == \"Tennessee\" | School == \"Florida St.\" | School == \"Kentucky\" | School == \"NC State\" | School == \"Texas A&M\" | School == \"Florida\")\n\neracws24 &lt;- newera24 |&gt;  \n  filter(School == \"North Carolina\" | School == \"Virginia\" | School == \"Tennessee\" | School == \"Florida St.\" | School == \"Kentucky\" | School == \"NC State\" | School == \"Texas A&M\" | School == \"Florida\")\n\nrunscws24 &lt;- newruns24 |&gt;  \n  filter(School == \"North Carolina\" | School == \"Virginia\" | School == \"Tennessee\" | School == \"Florida St.\" | School == \"Kentucky\" | School == \"NC State\" | School == \"Texas A&M\" | School == \"Florida\")\n\ntn_runs &lt;- runscws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Tennessee\")\ntn_era &lt;- eracws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Tennessee\")\ntn_hr &lt;- hrcws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Tennessee\")\n\ntx_runs &lt;- runscws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Texas A&M\")\ntx_era &lt;- eracws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Texas A&M\")\ntx_hr &lt;- hrcws24 |&gt; filter(School == \"Texas A&M\")\n\nerachart &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data= eracws24, aes(x=reorder(School, -ERA), weight= ERA), fill= \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data= tn_era, aes(x=reorder(School, -ERA), weight= ERA), fill= \"#FF8200\") +\n  geom_bar(data= tx_era, aes(x=reorder(School, -ERA), weight= ERA), fill= \"#500000\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Earned Run Average\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nhrchart &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data= hrcws24, aes(x=reorder(School, `Home Runs`), weight= `Home Runs`), fill= \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data= tn_hr, aes(x=reorder(School, `Home Runs`), weight= `Home Runs`), fill= \"#FF8200\") +\n  geom_bar(data= tx_hr, aes(x=reorder(School, `Home Runs`), weight= `Home Runs`), fill= \"#500000\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Home Runs\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nrunschart &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data= runscws24, aes(x=reorder(School, Runs), weight= Runs),fill= \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data= tn_runs, aes(x=reorder(School, Runs), weight= Runs), fill= \"#FF8200\") +\n  geom_bar(data= tx_runs, aes(x=reorder(School, Runs), weight= Runs), fill= \"#500000\") +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Runs Scored\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nhrchart + runschart / erachart +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"What Teams Advanced to Omaha Last Season?\", \n    subtitle=\"The statistics of each team that made it to the Men's College World Series last season, two teams \nthat made it to finals are in team color\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Treyson Marler \"\n    ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty simple.
